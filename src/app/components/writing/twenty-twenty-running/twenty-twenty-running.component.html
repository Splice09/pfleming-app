    <div class="introParagraph">
        As everyone in the world knows 2020 was an interesting year. I went through several phases: Cooking, Mixology, Jump rope, Reading, and many other temporary interests. However, one constant that helped keep me grounded through the dumpster fire of a year was running. <br><br>
        Once again, I am brought back to childhood. I remember being in the second and third grade and enjoying the competitive side of racing my classmates in P.E. Unfortunately, around the 4th grade I went through three ankle breaks and spent 18 months in a cast. For several years following that, I was an out of shape couch-potato. During my sophomore year in high school, I became interested in soccer and as I was playing in the front yard one day, my mom pointed out to me that when I was young, she thought I was going to be a runner. That moment inspired my first mile in high school. I don’t remember my total time, but it was somewhere around 12 minutes and I had to stop…a lot. After running nearly every day after school for a year I eventually got my time down to a consistent 6-minute mile and decided to join the cross-country team. It was a great experience, but by the end of it I was a little burnt out on running and suffered some weight gain when I was still hungry but not burning an additional 3000 calories a week. Around my third year of college, I decided to get back into it and wanted to try for a marathon. I had enough experience to develop a good training routine, but my knowledge of stretching and recovery ended my attempt with a severe knee pain. From that point forward, I would chug out the occasional 5k because I never wanted to lose the ability to run three miles without stopping, but the passion was lost. <br><br>
        Enter 2020. The climbing gym closed for the pandemic and I refused to sit around sulking in uncertainty and sadness. More so, I craved endorphins. I didn’t start out with any kind of intention, in fact, it wasn’t until around August when I crossed the 200 mile threshold that I realized I might have a goal on my hands. But I still kept track of all my runs using a combination of Excel, <a href="https://onthegomap.com/#/create">On the Go Map</a>, and a fitness wristwatch I got for Christmas. These are the results. <br><br>

        First is a cumulative distance run over time. Honestly this graph surprised me a lot because it displayed in a much more linear fashion that what I would expect from some of the bar graphs below.

        This is a breakdown of the total miles I ran each month. For my 29th birthday I decided to push and do a ten mile run to celebrate. Big mistake. I ended up rattling in the last mile on my skeleton and my right knee was not happy. As a result I practically took July off and had to ease back into it.

        Next is a very similar graph to the one above, but with a breakdown of how many runs I went on each month. Something that is worth noting from this is that as I got towards the end of the year, I was really pushing larger distance runs. Compare March to November, similar distances with almost half the runs.

    <div class="graphDescription">
        This is a graph of my average minute per mile over the course of the year. Something that I found interesting about this graph was how my time changes lagged a bit behind periods of high and low activity. It seems to take about one month for my fitness to fade and another month to build it back up. Something to remember when avoiding becoming discouraged when I get back into exercising after a break.

    <div class="graphDescription">
        Finally, I graphed out the time I spent running each month. This actually was pretty consistent all year long because speed changes were less significant. Checking the graph above I floated between 8:30 and 10:00 minute miles. So on a minute per run basis I’m only looking at saving around 7 minutes on a five mile run at my most fit.

    <div class="closingRemarks">
        Overall, I am grateful that the pandemic for pushed this hobby back on me. I have come to really enjoy multiple aspects of it. The meditative state I get into from an hour long run. The flood of endorphins that follows. The cool wave of refreshment at the first sip of chilled water. The genuine feeling of accomplishment when you’re completely exhausted in the shower. The incredibly deep sleep. Hopefully this time, it sticks.<br><br>

        Some closing fun facts:
        <ul>
            <li>I ran a total of 365.41 miles</li>
            <li>The distance I ran was greater than the distance between Atlanta Georgia and Mobile Alabama</li>
            <li>I completed my last run of the year on December 23, 2020</li>
            <li>I spent a total of 56 hours 3 minutes running in 2020</li>
            <li>I burned a total of 36541 calories or 18.27 days assuming a 2000 calorie diet </li>
