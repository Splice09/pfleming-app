    <div class="introParagraph">
        As a child I was a voracious reader. Partly because my parents offered a reward, "one pack of Pokemon cards for every book completed that contained over 150 pages." 
        And partly because my childhood was filled with books my adolecent brain found to be absolute bangers. Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, The Rangers Apprentice, 
        The Giver, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. 
        There has never been a shortage of enjoyable literature; however, as I wrapped up highschool and eased into college, 
        I somehow lost touch with the desire to spend my time consuming it. 
        <br><br>
        I've still managed to add a piece to my collection here and there over the years, but it wasn't until I started listening to Audio Books as a means to
        survive long drives that I really started enjoying stories again. In fact my Audibleâ„¢ Library (not sponsored <span class="weak">call me</span>) 
        has partially elevated my ego to that of a Sci-Fi/Fantasy snob.
        <br><br>
        Well, here we are. I've combined my new-found interest in consuming stories with a year where...frankly, we all have too much free time. The result? This highly regarded,
        ultra pretentious, world renowned -- Two Thousand Twenty A.D. Reading List. 
        <br><br>
        So crack open a fresh PBR and buckle up.
