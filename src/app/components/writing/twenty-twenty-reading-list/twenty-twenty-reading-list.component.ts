        "score": "7/10",
        "myThoughts": "This book provides an amazing look at some deeper questions and philosophies for life. It gave me some amazing context through its lense of classically minded vs romantically minded people. I docked a few points because the main character can be a bit self-fellating in his rhetoric. Overall, a combination of taking me so many years to finish and Pirsig's afterward and explaining his inspiration for the story had me tearing up.",

        "myThoughts": "It's not a cure all and I certainly needed more than 30 days, but this book has some excellent advice -- some of which I still use nearly a year later. Having a daily objective to look foward to was an excellent goal based approach to keep me going through the worst of it.",

        "score": "4 out of 7.5 hours wasted",
        "myThoughts": "I found this book insanely annoying. The author goes on and on about how her life was in shambles and then gushes about how she turned it all around. Followed by a bunch of success stories from people the rule worked for. I can grant that it's useful procedure for some, but the message amounts to the Nike slogan of \"Just Do It.\" Looking at the positives: 1) Her husbands name is Christopher Robbins which is just close enough to be amusing. 2) I used the 5 second rule to decide to stop reading the book.",

        "myThoughts": "Initially, it felt like this book made a lot of sense. But after giving it some time, I feel like it falls into a similar camp of the Meyers-Briggs or Enneagram of Personality. It seems like a potentially useful tool for psychotherapists but I'm hesitant to self-assign labels. I don't want to feel like one attachment style defines me and inhibit my own personal development. As far as theories go, it at least seemed well founded.",

I will probably read it again in the future to remind myself of the D√†o. It ends at the Enchanted Place at the top of the forest. \"To get there, just take the path to Nothing and go Nowhere until you reach it. Because the Enchanted Place is right where you are, and if you're Friendly With Bears, you can find it.\"",

        "myThoughts": "It was a short page turner so I didn't mind it too much. The action was decent, but I felt like they spent too much time describing characters I'll never see again. I will probably not be continuing my emersion into the Murderbot universe.",

        "myThoughts": "The second book felt a bit more like a coming of age story. It was still an exciting tale with an insanely powerful female lead. However, it added some traits to the main character that were perhaps too realistic for a fictional universe and felt a bit sexist instead. Downgrading the score just a bit from the first.",

However, I have continuously been impressed at how well Grisham is able to connect me with characters in a mere 50 pages per short story. He keeps the character list simple and paints scenes really well.",
